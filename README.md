# Bachelor Thesis application: Average portrait of people group.

Python prototype and C# tool for creating average portraits.

This application is the basis of my bachelor thesis. 
I'm not proud of it. It was one of my big mistakes.
There is almost no math, and coding is simple. So noting interest here except result pictures maybe.

At the begin (in python prototype) I tryied to use Haar cascade to detect faces and eyes. It works, but final result was poor. So I decided to markup eyes by hand.
